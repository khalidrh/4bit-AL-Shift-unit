4-bit ALU with Shifter Unit
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with an integrated Shifter Unit using Electric VLSI.

Features
Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Increment, Decrement
Logical Operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
Shift Operations: Left Shift, Right Shift (Logical & Arithmetic)
CMOS-based design with schematic and layout implementation
Tools Used
Electric VLSI for schematic & layout
SPICE Simulation for verification
GitHub for version control
How to Use
Open the .elib files in Electric VLSI.
Run SPICE simulations using the .sp files.
Future Work
Implement additional arithmetic operations
Optimize power and area efficiency
